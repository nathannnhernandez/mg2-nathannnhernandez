# HW2
## Devlog
The most important part for my success in this minigame that we did in the in class activity on Tuesday was discussing the GameController. Had my group not discussed the importance of a GameController in this instance I would have forgotten to implement one which would have slowed my progress tremoundously. Instead, I was able to refresh myself on instantiating prefabs, keeping score, and managing UI through a GameController.
